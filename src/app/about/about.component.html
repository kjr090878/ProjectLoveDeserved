        <p class="about-text">Project Love Deserved is a volunteer-based organization that focuses on helping our elderly. Unfortunately, many elderly citizens, who are of sound body and mind, end up only having one choice if they can not physically do for themselves and they don’t have any family or able-bodied friends that live near.  They end up at an elderly care home. Oftentimes, these homes are extremely expensive and beyond the cost of living at home, without the perks of freedom to live their lives as they see fit.</p>

        <p class="about-text">It’s all of the stories of the elderly and their difficulty to be able to get the help they need that burden my heart! It pains me to hear that a friend of my grandmother’s had to call the paramedics to get her up from a sitting position because she had no one else that she could call to help her, which means a hefty bill later for emergency services. Project Love Deserved seeks to change our way of caring for our elderly who can’t afford to pay the paramedics bill to help them get up. We seek to assist those that don’t fit into any existing charities, with things like cleaning house, yard work, or just changing a lightbulb. I poled several people who fit into this category and they all agreed that things like cleaning and grocery store/errands would be extremely helpful. I feel strongly, that Project Love Deserved will address the need our community has for those that suffer physical constraints, and can not afford to pay for the help they need. You can help by offering time or contributing donations. After all, one day all of us will become “the elderly”, and what will take care of us then? Please help support our cause!</p>
